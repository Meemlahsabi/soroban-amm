# Event schema versioning (#302)

Every event emitted by the AMM, CL, governance, factory (and any future
contract that adopts the pattern) carries a `schema_version: u32`
field. Off-chain consumers (GraphQL indexer, health dashboard, any
WebSocket subscriber) read this field before decoding the rest of
the payload so an unexpected version can be quarantined rather than
silently misinterpreted.

## How it's emitted

Every emit site uses the `soroban_amm_sdk::emit_versioned_event!`
macro instead of `env.events().publish(...)`:

```rust
// Before:
env.events().publish(
    (Symbol::new(&env, "swap"), trader.clone()),
    (token_in, amount_in, token_out, amount_out),
);

// After (#302):
soroban_amm_sdk::emit_versioned_event!(
    env,
    (Symbol::new(&env, "swap"), trader.clone()),
    (token_in, amount_in, token_out, amount_out),
);
```

The macro expands to:

```rust
env.events().publish(
    /* topic */ (Symbol::new( &env, "swap"), trader.clone()),
    /* data  */ (soroban_amm_sdk::EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION, (token_in, amount_in, token_out, amount_out)),);

```

So the on-wire shape is `(version: u32, original_payload)`. **Topic is
unchanged** -- consumers can keep filtering by event name + author the
way they always have.

## How consumers decode

```rust
let (version, payload): (u32, (Address, i128, Address, i128)) =
    event.data.try_into_val(env)?;

match version {
    1 => decode_v1(payload),
    2 => decode_v2(payload),  // future
    other => {
        log::warn!("unknown event schema version {other}; skipping");
        return Ok(());
    }
}
```

## When to bump `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`

`pub const EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION: u32 = 1;` lives in
`contracts/amm-sdk/src/lib.rs`.

Bump it (single integer, +1 per release) when ANY event's payload
shape changes:

- Field added
- Field removed
- Field type changed
- Field order changed (Soroban encodes tuples positionally)
- Field renamed (no runtime effect, but indexers that key on names
  will break)

Don't bump for:

- Adding a new event type (consumers can ignore unknown topics)
- Changing event topic content (topic is separate from payload a
  topic change is independently observable)

## Versioning is global, not per-event

One `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` covers every contract event in the
workspace. The alternative -- per-event version -- was rejected because:

1. Consumer state machines would have to track N independent version
   sequences, one per event type.
2. The contracts ship together as a single workspace release; if any
   event payload changes, the deployment cycle re-bumps every consumer
   anyway.
3. A global version is one branch in the consumer's decoder, not N.

The cost is that bumping any event's payload bumps the "version" for
every event, even unchanged ones. That's fine: consumers see the
unchanged payload as the same bytes, just with a different `version`
prefix -- easy to validate during the upgrade window.

## Affected contracts

The catalogue below is the current source-level event inventory for the contracts
that emit versioned events. Keep it synchronized with every
`emit_versioned_event!` call when adding or changing events; do not rely on a
hard-coded site count because tests and helper examples may also contain macro
calls.

`contracts/staking/src/lib.rs` was inspected but has no event emissions
yet -- once it starts emitting it should adopt the macro from day one.

`contracts/twal_consumer/src/lib.rs` is intentionally out of scope. It
already emitted an unversioned `snapshot_deleted` event before this
migration, and the tracked-pool lifecycle events added in #695
(`pool_add`, `pool_remove`) follow that same existing, unversioned
convention rather than mixing versioning schemes within one contract.
Migrating `twal_consumer` to `emit_versioned_event!` — all three event
sites at once — is left as a follow-up.

Test files in each of those crates were updated to decode the
versioned payload shape; see `__ver_N_locals+ assert_eq(!version,
EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION)` assertions added by `migrate_tests.py`.

## New events in this change

The factory now emits two additional events:

- `pool_meta`: emitted when pool metadata is created or updated. Payload:
  `(schema_version: u32, (label: String, category: PoolCategory, created_at: u64, created_by: Address, verified: bool))`.
- `pool_ver`: emitted when the verified flag changes. Payload:
  `(schema_version: u32, verified: bool)`.

Consumers should ignore unknown topics; existing versioning rules apply.

## Event catalogue

Every row below has the on-wire data shape `(schema_version, payload)`.
The topic is the event name, optionally followed by the address shown in the
`topics` column. Field types use the Rust/Soroban names from the emitting
contract.

### Constant-product AMM — `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs`

| Event | Topics | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `swap` | `trader` | `(token_in: Address, amount_in: i128, token_out: Address, amount_out: i128)` on standard paths; the fee-on-transfer path uses `(token_in, actual_received, token_out, amount_out, referrer: Option<Address>)` |
| `flash_loan` | `receiver` | `(amount_a: i128, amount_b: i128, fee_a: i128, fee_b: i128)` |
| `fot_detected` | `token_in` | `(amount_in: i128, actual_received: i128)` |
| `add_liquidity` | `provider` | `(amount_a: i128, amount_b: i128, shares: i128)` |
| `rm_liq` | — | `(provider: Address, shares: i128, amount_a: i128, amount_b: i128)` |
| `rm_liq_1s` | — | `(provider: Address, shares: i128, token_out: Address, amount_out: i128)` |
| `admin_nominated` | — | `(current_admin: Address, new_admin: Address)` |
| `admin_changed` | — | `(new_admin: Address)` |

| `cb_config` | — | `(threshold_bps: i128, cooldown_secs: u64)` |
| `circuit_break` | — | `(baseline_price: i128, current_price: i128, deviation_bps: i128, threshold_bps: i128)` |
| `emergency_withdraw` | `admin` | `(to: Address, reserve_a: i128, reserve_b: i128)` |
| `flash_fee_upd` | `admin` | `(new_fee_bps: i128)` |
| `lp_rebate_set` | `admin` | `(lp_rebate_bps: i128)` |
| `multisig_set` | `admin` | `(quorum: u32)` |
| `ms_proposed` | `signer` | `(recipient: Address, approvals: u32)` |
| `ms_ew` | `signer` | `(to: Address, reserve_a: i128, reserve_b: i128)` |

The two swap payload variants and all configuration payloads above are emitted
by the current source. Consumers should use the event topic and the global
schema version together when selecting a decoder.

| `vetoed` | `(proposal_id: u64, multisig: Address, now: u64, discussion_end: u64)` |

### Consumer rules

A consumer must inspect the leading `schema_version` before decoding any row in
this catalogue. It may decode a version it explicitly supports, quarantine a
newer version, and ignore an unknown topic. A payload shape change requires a
single global version bump even if the change affects only one event; adding a
new topic does not require a bump by itself.
